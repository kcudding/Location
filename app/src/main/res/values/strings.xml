        This app will track location in the background for a teaching activity between November and
        December. Your
        identity will not be recorded and all data will be password protected.\n\nTo participate:
        \n1.Select Permissions>Location>\'Allow all the time\' to allow the app
        to run in the background.\n
        2. Click \'I agree, start tracking\'.\nPeerLearn will
        indicate that it is tracking location\n\n



        The location data will be used to simulate disease dynamics, which advanced
        students will analyze and model. They will present their findings and explain
        the models to the early year undergrads who provide the data.
        This peer learning exercise is designed to increase your understanding of quantitative
        methods.\n\nYou may discontinue location tracking at any time in the App settings.If at any
        time you wish your data to be deleted please contact us directly.\n\n
