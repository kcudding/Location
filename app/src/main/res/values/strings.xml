        This app will track location in the background for a teaching activity. Your
        identity will not be recorded and all data will be password protected.\n\nThe location data
        will be used to simulate disease dynamics, which advanced
        students will analyze and model. They will present their findings and explain
        the models to the early year undergrads who provide the data.
        This peer learning exercise is designed to increase your understanding of quantitative
        methods.\n\nIf you wish to participate: Please select \'Always allow\' in Location
        permissions to allow the app to run in the background.\n

        1. Click \'Set location permissions\'.\n
        2. Go to:\n Permissions>Location>Allow all the time\n
        3. Then cick \'I agree, start tracking\'.\nPeerLearn will
        indicate that it is tracking location\n
